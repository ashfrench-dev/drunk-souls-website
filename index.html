        <h1>Drunk Souls: A Dark Souls Drinking Game</h1>
        <p class="intro">
            Ready to stumble through the world of Lordran with a drink in hand and a fire in your belly?
            Grab your drinks, summon your bravest friends, and prepare to test your liver's endurance as you face off against the most infamously cruel bosses and treacherous traps.
            Remember, in this game, the real boss is your sobriety!
            May your aim be as sharp as a Dragonslayer's spear and your tolerance as sturdy as a Black Iron Tarkus.
            Cheers to a night of epic quests and even more epic fails!
        </p>
